The blend ecosystem, or becosys, is a comprehensive framework, built on a real-time communication infrastructure, that encompasses artificial intelligence, various devices, operating systems, and cloud services to orchestrate a unified intelligent environment for the user.

Key components include:

Blendpoint: The umbrella title for the network of cloud services in the blend ecosystem, including the central server using WebSocket.

Blentry: A family of services for protecting internet services in the blend ecosystem, consisting of Bleacon, Blendstrap, and Blendauth.

BlendOS: The operating system at the center of the blend ecosystem, with versions for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Performance Critical Components (C++), and devices created from scratch (usually Python).

BlendAI: The AI interpreter for the blend ecosystem, utilizing Python (NLP, CV, ML, DL), JavaScript (web-based interaction), Swift (iOS and MacOS), C++ (Performance Critical Components), and Go (backend services). Also, includes third-party APIs and Blendlib Library.

Blendlib: A library of vitals, speech, and personalized information fine-tuned to the main user of the blend ecosystem to enhance the AI experience.

Helpinghand: Family of performance-critical devices for physical aid, including Blendarm, Auxbench, and Tailbeam.

Partisan: Family of monitoring tools for security and safety, including Airlock, Atmosphere Control, Contingency, Copilot, and Aisight Family.

Aisight: Troop of cameras, sensors, algorithms, triggers, and microphones for monitoring every inch of the blend ecosystem.
